# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

### Added

- A CI gate for npm lockfiles, resolved Gradle modules and GitHub Actions, using
  one advisory snapshot for base/head. PRs fail on new findings and malware;
  default-branch daily scans and open-PR rescans keep verdicts current.
- Release-age, publisher/source identity, repository-advisory, exception and
  dependency-floor checks, including proof of eligible young security fixes.
- Standalone secure-it: non-major security batches, separate majors, peer-coupled
  direct fixes, and jointly verified unlocked removal of redundant security
  floors. Compatibility floors remain unchanged.
- Standalone bump-it: routine refreshes, separate capped/deferred majors,
  tool-computed exact npm files and checksummed Gradle wrapper generation.
  Peer-blocked major PRs are retained and reported during review.
- Shared sandboxed repository commands, isolated credentials, PR race checks,
  publication journal recovery, deterministic reconciliation and bounded CI
  adaptation. CI reads Actions and commit statuses without Checks permission.
- Per-tool PAT/Keychain defaults, strict configuration, current/legacy label
  recognition, candidate preview, launchd examples, logs and cost reporting.
- Provenance for copied agent basics, an adoption/configuration guide, security
  model, coverage gaps and a real-run validation record for wrapper generation
  and Gradle/npm floor removal.

### Scope

- Packages are private and consumed by pinned Git commit; no npm publication.
- Local tools currently run on macOS. GitHub App mode is future work; PAT mode
  remains supported. Unsupported ecosystems and other limits are documented in
  `docs/coverage-gaps.md`.
